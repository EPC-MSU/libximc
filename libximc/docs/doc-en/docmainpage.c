 * Libximc is **thread safe**, cross-platform library for working with 8SMC4-USB and 8SMC5-USB controllers.
 *
 * Full documentation about controllers is <a href="https://doc.xisupport.com">there</a>
 *
 * Full documentation about libximc API is available on the page <a href="https://libximc.xisupport.com/doc-en/ximc_8h.html">ximc.h.</a>
 *
 * \section what_the_controller_does What the controller does.
 *
 * - Supports input and output synchronization signals to ensure the joint operation of multiple devices within a complex system ;.
 * - Works with all compact stepper motors with a winding current of up to 3 A, without feedback, as well as with stepper motors equipped with an encoder in the feedback circuit, including a linear encoder on the positioner.
 * - Manages hardware using ready-made software or using libraries for programming languages: C / C ++, C #, JAVA, Visual Basic, Python 2/3, .NET, Delphi, integration with MS Visual Studio programming environments, gcc, Xcode.
 * - Works with scientific development environments by integrating LabVIEW and MATLAB;
 *
 * \section what_can_do_library What can do libximc library
 *
 * - Libximc manages hardware using interfaces: USB 2.0., RS232 and Ethernet, also uses a common and proven virtual serial port interface, so you can work with motor control modules through this library under almost all operating systems, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X
 * - Libximc library supports plug/unplug on the fly. Each device can be controlled only by one program at once. Multiple processes (programs) that control one device simultaneously are not allowed.
 *
 * \warning
 * Libximc library opens the controller in exclusive access mode. Any controller opened with libximc (XiLab also uses this library) needs to be closed before it may be used by another process. So at first check that you have closed XiLab or other software dealing with the controller before trying to reopen the controller.

 *
 * \section howtouse_python_sec Python
 *
 * Change current directory to the examples/test_Python.
 * For correct usage of the library libximc, the example uses the file wrapper, crossplatform\wrappers\python\pyximc.py with a description of the structures of the library.
 *
 * Before launch:
 *
 * On OS X: copy library ximc/macosx/libximc.framework to the current directory.
 *
 * On Linux: you may need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
 * so Python can locate libraries with RPATH. For example, you may need:
 * \code
 * export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:`pwd`
 * \endcode
 *
 * On Windows before the start nothing needs to be done. All necessary communication and dependencies are registered in the example code.
 * Libraries used: libximc.dll xibridge.dll. Located in the folder for the respective versions of Windows.
 *
 * Launch Python 2 or Python 3:
 * \code
 * python test_Python.py

 *
 * Before launch:
 *
 * On OS X: copy ximc/macosx/libximc.framework, ximc/macosx/wrappers/ximcm.h,
 * ximc/ximc.h * to the directory examples/matlab. Install XCode compatible with Matlab.
 *
 * On Linux: install libximc*deb and libximc-dev*dev of target architecture.
 * Then copy ximc/macosx/wrappers/ximcm.h to the directory examples/matlab. Install gcc compatible with Matlab.
 *
 * For XCode and gcc version compability check document 
 * https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/support/sysreq/files/SystemRequirements-Release2014a_SupportedCompilers.pdf or similar.

 * 
 * \section howtouse_log Generic logging facility
 *
 * If you want to turn on file logging, you should run the program that uses libximc library with the "XILOG" environment variable set to desired file name.
 * This file will be opened for writing on the first log event and will be closed when the program which uses libximc terminates.
 * Data which is sent to/received from the controller is logged along with port open and close events.
 *
 * \section howtouse_perm Required permissions
 *
 * libximc generally does not require special permissions to work, it only needs read/write access to USB-serial ports on the system.
 * An exception to this rule is a Windows-only "fix_usbser_sys()" function - it needs elevation and will produce null result if run as a regular user.
 *
 * \section howtouse_cprofiles C-profiles
 * 
 * C-profiles are header files distributed with the libximc library. They enable one to set all controller settings for any of the supported stages with a single function call in a C/C++ program.
 * You may see how to use C-profiles in "testcprofile" example directory.
 *
 * \page userunit_sec Working with custom units
 *
 * In addition to working in basic units(steps, encoder value), the library allows you to work with custom units.
 * For this purpose are used: 
 * - The structure of the conversion units calibration_t
 * - The functions of which have doubles for working with custom units, data structures for these functions
 * - Coordinate correction table for more accurate positioning
 * 
 * \section userunit_calb1 The structure of the conversion units calibration_t
 *
 * To specify conversion of the basic units in the user and back, calibration_t structure is used.
 * With the help of coefficients A and MicrostepMode, specified in this structure, steps and microsteps which are integers are converted into the user value of the real type and back.
 *
 * Conversion formulas:
 * - The conversion to user units.
 * \verbatim
	user_value = A*(step + mstep/pow(2,MicrostepMode-1))
	\endverbatim
 * - Conversion from custom units.
 * \verbatim
	step = (int)(user_value/A)
	mstep = (user_value/A - step)*pow(2,MicrostepMode-1)
	\endverbatim
 *
 * \section userunit_calb2 Alternative functions for working with custom units and data structures for them
 * Structures and functions for working with custom units have the _calb postfix.
 * The user using these functions can perform all actions in their own units without worrying about the computations of the controller.
 * The data format of _calb structures is described in detail. For _calb functions particular descriptions are not used. They perform the same actions as the basic functions do.
 * The difference between them and the basic functions is in the position, velocity, and acceleration of the data types defined as user-defined. If clarification for _calb functions is necessary, they are provided as notes in the description of the basic functions.
 *
 * \section userunit_corr Coordinate correction table for more accurate positioning
 *
 * Some functions for working with custom units support coordinate transformation using a correction table.
 * To load a table from a file, the load_correction_table() function is used. Its description contains the functions and their data supporting correction.
 *
 * \note
 * For data fields which are corrected in case of loading of the table in the description of the field is written - corrected by the table.
 *
 * File format: 
 * - two columns separated by tabs; 
 * - column headers are string; 
 * - real type data, point is a separator; 
 * - the first column is the coordinate, the second is the deviation caused by a mechanical error; 
 * - the deviation between coordinates is calculated linearly; 
 * - constant is equal to the deviation at the boundary beyond the range; 
 * - maximum length of the table is 100 lines.
 *
 * Sample file:
 * \verbatim
	X	dX
	0	0
	5.0	0.005
	10.0	-0.01
    \endverbatim
